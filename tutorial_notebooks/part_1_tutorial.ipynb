If you know what a loss aka cost aka objective function is and how a token aka input_id represents a vector aka embedding, you should be in good shape.\n",

    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the process of taking a model already pre-trained on a very large corpus of data, and re-training it carefully as not to erase the knowledge the model has gained from that pre-training [catastropic forgetting](https://github.com/clam004/intro_continual_learning), but rather slightly nudge the model to perform better in a more specific or narrow domain represented by a much smaller fine tuning dataset.\n",

    "Fine-tuning usually means training for only a small number of epochs with a much smaller learning rate, but also using the cross entropy loss function used to do pre-training, but this way to learning is abit limited, can you tell why? \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Figure 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This example of using cross entropy shows how the training algorithm rewards or penalizes based on how large the logit (probability mass asigned to) for \"cat\" is, just this one way of completing the sequence, but we know that in reality when generating responses to instructions, there isnt one right ways to do it even in the cases when there is one right answer, there are many ways to be good and many ways to be bad. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of keeping this tutorial light weight, fit on commonly available compute and intuitive, we have simplified the overall strategy in 2 major ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. ChatGPT and InstructGPT, although they are very specially trained with reinforcement learning (RL), when you generalize, ChatGPT is just taking some prompt, aka input text (the phrase or instructions) and generating an output, aka continuing that text (providing a response or answer). It takes alot more compute memory to represent these long instructions and long answers in the neural network transformers, so instead we simplify the input text to the start of a movie review (first few words or subwords) and simplify the continuing text to the continuation of those first few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. The reward modeling has been simplified as compared to InstructGPT https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/ which is the model that ChatGPT is a scaled up and improved version of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training a reward model based on human rankings of output text, which was done to make the reward signal more stable or reliable, we use the more direct tactic of using the logits from a classifier (like BERT) as the reward signal, \"positive meanss do more like this, negative means do less like this\", where positive means the review is a referring to movie the reviewer thinks is good (a positive review). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our limited time, I am going to focus on giving you what is hard to find. That is, good explainations of the parts that are usually glossed over yet important, or those parts that are usually explained in a much more jargony, field specific, technical or mathematical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we will be focusing on step 3 in Figure 1. Namely, how reinforcement learning, something we have seen thus far in the popular media mostly applied to computer games, instead applied to natural language, or the generation of sequences of discrete tokens. "

    "Next we find the log probabilities for each token in our responses, notice that the length of each element in the logprobs matches its corresponding pair in responses. We calculate the log probabilities not because we are implementing the reinforce policy gradient loss function [Policy Gradient Theorem](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/rl-policy-gradients-explained-9b13b688b146), but in order to calculate the [Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://machinelearningmastery.com/divergence-between-probability-distributions/) (KL divergence) between the old static policy and new dynamic policy. You see, in 2022 the current efforts in RL are still being directed to combat the high variance and sample inefficiency in training, in laymens terms, trying to keep the neural network from spining out of control, losing its mind, while being updated, part of this involves keeping track of how much the behavior of the neural network in training has drifted away from the initial behavior, we measure this drift using the KL divergence between the two models outputs.

    "It leaves out a a few steps between the deepest, aka last, or top most blue box and the word that comes out ot it. Implicit in Blue Figure is that just like in grey green pink Figure 3, in order for a token or word to be outputted from the top, the `h`'s go thru a linear layer to form `logits` and a softmax layer to form a vector of probabilities the same length as the number of possible tokens. Once you have this vector of probabilities, you have several options, you could choose the token with highest probability (ie a greedy approach) or sample based on those probabilities such that you have a higher chance of sampling reasonable tokens over unreasonable ones, ie `'I saw a cat on a'-> {'mat' > 'desk' > 'sofa' >>> 'cloud'} ` , this is what we chose, to sample, when we indicated `do_sample=True` above, which is why everytime you run the `response = ppo_trainer.generate(query, **lab.generation_kwargs)` you get different continuations of the beginning prompt text. \n",

    "Blue Figure supposes that tokens are words, notice how the word at the top of one column of boxes shows up at the bottom of the boxes of the next column just to the right of it. Basically they are saying that whatever token is sampled from the logits (softmaxed logits) gets incorporated into the newest, rightmost, part of the elongating sequence, and fed back into the transformer to generate the next set of logits to sample from and so on and so on. So if `t` is the position in the sequence, the token at position `t` is sampled from the logits at position `t - 1`, one position behind it. And since the torch.gather function is basically using the tokens in `input_ids`, to pick out the log probability in `logp` that corresponds to that token, we feed the `gather` function the `logits` and `input_ids` with `input_ids` shifted one position forward. \n",

    "This tutorial assumes the reader has some basic machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) knowledge, but is new to training large language models, aka foundation models, aka transformer neural networks, using reinforcement learning. If you know what a loss aka cost aka objective function is and how a token aka input_id represents a vector aka embedding, you should be good.\n",

    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the process of taking a model already pre-trained on a very large corpus of data, and re-training it carefully as not to erase the knowledge the model has gained from that pre-training [catastropic forgetting](https://github.com/clam004/intro_continual_learning), but rather slightly nudge the model to perform better in a more specific or narrow domain represented by a much smaller fine tuning dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already plenty of resources on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) aka fine-tuning already, some with impressively good explanations, mistakenly claiming to help you build a mini-chatgpt. I will not cover SFT, instead I will point you to some of my favorite resources. \n",

    "### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning usually means training for only a small number of epochs with a much smaller learning rate, but also using the cross entropy loss function used to do pre-training, but this way to learning is abit limited, can you tell why? \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Figure 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This example of using cross entropy shows how the training algorithm rewards or penalizes based on how large the logit (probability mass asigned to) for \"cat\" is, just this one way of completing the sequence, but we know that in reality when generating responses to instructions, there isnt one right ways to do it even in the cases when there is one right answer, there are many ways to be good and many ways to be bad. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of keeping this tutorial light weight, fit on commonly available compute and intuitive, we have simplified the overall strategy in 2 major ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. ChatGPT and InstructGPT, although they are very specially trained with reinforcement learning (RL), when you generalize, ChatGPT is just taking some prompt, aka input text (the phrase or instructions) and generating an output, aka continuing that text (providing a response or answer). It takes alot more compute memory to represent these long instructions and long answers in the neural network transformers, so instead we simplify the input text to the start of a movie review (first few words or subwords) and simplify the continuing text to the continuation of those first few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. The reward modeling has been simplified as compared to InstructGPT https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/ which is the model that ChatGPT is a scaled up and improved version of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training a reward model based on human rankings of output text, which was done to make the reward signal more stable or reliable, we use the more direct tactic of using the logits from a classifier (like BERT) as the reward signal, \"positive meanss do more like this, negative means do less like this\", where positive means the review is a referring to movie the reviewer thinks is good (a positive review). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our limited time, I am going to focus on giving you what is hard to find. That is, good explainations of the parts that are usually glossed over yet important, or those parts that are usually explained in a much more jargony, field specific, technical or mathematical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we will be focusing on step 3 in Figure 1. Namely, how reinforcement learning, something we have seen thus far in the popular media mostly applied to computer games, instead applied to natural language, or the generation of sequences of discrete tokens. "
